# MMCX_2DD-100P
Adapter between MMCX connectors to a 2DD 100 pin connector for Gretina cards

Requires two PCBs on 47 mil board, one for even channel and one for odd channels.
MMCX_2DD-100P_Even.zip and MMCX_2DD-100P_Odd.zip

Uses MMCX connectors: MOLEX 0734150961
The other connector is a double density 100 pin DSub connector: ITT Cannon 2DD-100P

Any MMCX plug can connector to the adapter, such as MOLEX 0734150970

The connector housing is in three pieces, two half shells and a spacer that goes between them. 
The two half shells are made of two material so that channel labels and the UNC logo are visible. This is all contained in: HousingLogoLabeled.2mf

The boards will be mounted at and angle, and the pins need to be soldered on first. A jig is recommended to insert the board without bending the pins:
InsertionGuideA.stl and InsertionGuideB.stl

To solder the pins in the correct position a connector with the holes drilled so the pins don't get stuck was used previously. Printing a jig for the pins from 2DD-100P.ipt should also work, but verify the hole spacing first.
